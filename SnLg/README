Sn/Lg Analysis Code Package (ver260623)

    This package provides tools to perform Sn/Lg seismic waveform analysis for multiple event-station pairs. The workflow includes data preparation, waveform retrieval, Sn/Lg processing (both serial and parallel), and postprocessing.

1. get_seismic_waveforms.py
    Provides functions to download seismic waveforms using ObsPy.

    Key function: get_waveform_from_client – downloads waveform data from online data centers (e.g., IRIS).

2. snlg_analyses.py
    The core module for Sn/Lg analysis.

    This module performs Sn/Lg analysis for each event-station pair and stores the results as a Python list of SnLg_OneEventStationPair dataclass instances.
    Key components:
        SnLg_OneEventStationPair class (lines 22–79): Defines the structure of the result object and the variables you can extract from it.
    Key functions:
        process_snlg_bulk: Runs serial processing on all event-station pairs.
        process_snlg_bypair: Supports parallel processing for improved performance on large datasets.

3. snlg_tools.py
    Utility functions for handling .pkl files containing Sn/Lg results.

    Reference notebook: See STEP2_PostProcessing_Plot.ipynb for some usage examples.

4. STEP0_Preparation.ipynb
    Notebook for preparing input earthquake catalogs.

    Tasks may include:
        Converting raw catalog formats to a standardized structure.
        Interpolating Moho depth from a given crustal model.

5. STEP1_Multiple_IRIS_bulk.ipynb
    Runs Sn/Lg analysis in serial mode.

    Recommended for exploring and understanding the workflow.

6. STEP1_Multiple_IRIS_parallel.py
    Runs Sn/Lg analysis in parallel mode.

    Recommended for processing large datasets efficiently.
    
7. STEP2_PostProcessing_Plot.ipynb
    An example notebook for postprocessing and visualization of analysis results.
